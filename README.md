# Project Overview
This repository contains my work for module including tasks and the Eliza chatbot project. The tasks and the project focus on language modeling using trigrams and creating a client-side ELIZA chatbot.
The assessment is divided into two main parts
* **Tasks (40%)**: A series of tasks completed using Python in a Jupyter notebook.
* **Project (40%)**: A client-side ELIZA chatbot implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Repository Structure
* trigrams.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the solutions to the tasks.

  * **Task 1**: Third-order letter approximation model.
  * **Task 2**: Generation of text using the trigram model.
  * **Task 3**: Analyze the generated text for real English words.
  * **Task 4**: Export the trigram model as JSON.
* eliza/: Directory containing the ELIZA chatbot project.

  * **index.html**: Main HTML page for the chatbot.
  * **style.css**: CSS for the chatbot interface.
  * **eliza.js**: JavaScript file containing the chatbot logic.
* **words.txt**: A list of English words for use in Task 3.


# Tasks
## Task 1: Third-order Letter Approximation Model
In this task, I created a trigram model by analyzing five English works from Project Gutenberg. The following steps were performed:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The text data was cleaned by removing preambles, postambles, and non-ASCII characters (except for letters, spaces, and full stops).
2.  **Trigram Model**: A trigram model was generated by counting the frequency of three-character sequences in the cleaned text.

## Task 2: Third-order Letter Approximation Generation
Using the trigram model from Task 1, I generated a string of 10,000 characters. The generation process involves:

1.  Starting with the initial string "TH."
2. Selecting the next character based on the trigram frequencies,.
The output is a random string of characters generated using the trigram model.

## Task 3: Analyze Your Model
In this task, I compared the generated 10,000-character string with a list of actual English words from words.txt to calculate the percentage of words in the string that are valid English words. This helps evaluate the quality of the trigram model.

## Task 4: Export Your Model as JSON
The trigram model was exported in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, allowing it to be used in other applications or analysis.
# Project: ELIZA Chatbot
## Overview
The ELIZA chatbot simulates a conversation with a therapist, responding to user input in a manner similar to the classic ELIZA program. The chatbot runs entirely on the client side, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on external libraries or APIs.

## Features
*  **Text Box**: Users can input their text to interact with the chatbot.
*  **Conversation History**: The chatbot's responses and the user's inputs are displayed in a conversation history area.
*  **Chatbot Logic**: The chatbot responds based on keyword matching and simple transformations, emulating the behavior of the original ELIZA program.
## Files
*  **index.html**: Contains the structure of the chatbot interface.
*  **style.css**: Provides styling for the chatbot interface, including input box, conversation area, and overall layout.
*  **eliza.js**: Contains the logic for the chatbot, including handling user input, generating responses, and updating the conversation history.
# Deployment
The ELIZA chatbot is deployed to GitHub Pages and can be accessed via the following link:
